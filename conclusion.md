# Conclusion

"Survival of the fittest" is a misinterpretation of the thesis of Charles Darwin's 1859 classic, "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection." It is much better described as "survival of the most adaptable." All things being equal, being the fittest may make you more likely to pass on your genes to future generations \(which is what natural selection is all about\). But being the most adaptable makes you more likely to survive extraordinary circumstances that might otherwise kill you \(thereby preventing you from passing on your genes at all\). The very definition of a survivor is someone who had the ability to adapt to unanticipated \(sometimes catastrophic\) change and lived to tell the tale.

No one needs to tell you how quickly your world is changing. You don't need to manage change, you just need to adapt to it!
