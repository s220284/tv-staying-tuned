# Television: Staying Tuned

I've assembled this collection of essays to inspire you to think about the business of television in the context of our data-driven, machine learning-assisted world. In success, it will act as a primer and a thought starter.

Things that have my attention include:

* Blockchain and Smart Contracts
* Augmented Reality \(AR\)
* Man/Machine Learning Partnerships
* Sensor Technology
* Well-matched Algorithms & Training Sets
* Accelerated Disruption of the Media Business by Streaming
* The Evolution of Retail
* Chat as an App Killer

This is not a comprehensive list, but I hope it will help you guide your journey.

## A Few Words About Data

### The Velocity of Data is Increasing and Will Always Increase

The velocity of data is increasing and will always increase. How much data are we talking about? Analysts expect the Internet of Things \(IoT\) to generate over 500 zettabytes of data in 2019 — 49 times current cloud traffic.

### How Big is a Zettabyte?

One bit or binary digital is the smallest \(and largest\) unit of computer data. Bits are generally arranged and stored in eight-bit multiples called bytes. One thousand bytes equals a kilobyte or KB. One million bytes equals a megabyte or MB. One billion bytes equals a gigabyte or GB. One trillion bytes equals a terabyte or TB.

We all know about how much we can store on a one-terabyte drive, so let’s do the rest of the ordinals related to the number of terabytes — it will be easier to deal with.

A petabyte or one PB is equal to 1,000 terabytes. An exabyte or EB is equal to a million terabytes and a zettabyte or ZB, the size of the number we are trying to understand, is equal to one billion terabytes. If that’s how much data we’ll store in the cloud by 2019, you might as well know that 500 zettabytes is equal to half a yottabyte, and a yottabyte or YB is equal to one trillion terabytes. Now, that’s a yotta data — sorry, I couldn’t resist.

Before we get started, here are four observed laws that will help you think about technological progress and when any given technology \(and the associated data\) may become important to you.

## Moore’s Law

> The number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years.

_This isn’t accurate. It’s more like one year, and the rate of change is accelerating. However, Moore’s law does speak to the idea of exponential growth._

### Metcalfe’s Law

> The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system \(n²\).

_While the math here is also debatable, it is very obvious that the value of a network increases with each additional user. The only question is, by how much?_

### The Law of Accelerating Returns

> The rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems tends to increase exponentially.

_This is the least obvious of the four laws, but understanding the exponential rate of technological progress is critical to understanding how consumer behavior is likely to evolve._

### Cooper's Law

> The maximum number of voice conversations or equivalent data transactions that can be conducted in all of the useful radio spectrum over a given area doubles every 30 months.

_Otherwise known as the Law of Spectral Efficiency, Cooper's Law has been true for the past 104 years._

### What Does This All Mean to You?

Taken together, these observed laws suggest that today is the slowest rate of technological change you will ever experience in your lifetime; the more people are connected, the more powerful the network becomes; and, finally, data is a new frontier.

To get the most out of all of this data, we are going to need to learn how to harness its power.
