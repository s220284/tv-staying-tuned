# Television: Staying Tuned

I've assembled this collection of essays to inspire you to think about the business of television in the context of our data-driven, machine learning-assisted world. In success, it will act as a primer and a thought starter.

Things that have my attention include:

* Blockchain and Smart Contracts
* Augmented Reality \(AR\)
* Man/Machine Learning Partnerships
* Sensor Technology
* Well-matched Algorithms & Training Sets
* Accelerated Disruption of the Media Business by Streaming
* The Evolution of Retail
* Chat as an App Killer

This is not a comprehensive list, but I hope it will help you guide your journey.
